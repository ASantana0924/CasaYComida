# Casa Y Comida

Casa Y Comida is a free full-stack web application for disadvantaged people who need easy-to-access resources to help them locate nearby shelters, food banks, and libraries based off of their location in the United States. It is built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and uses the Google Maps API and the Google Places API.
